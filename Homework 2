// Problem 5

Consider an illumination problem: There are $n$ lamps and $m$ mirrors fixed to the ground. The target reflection intensity level is $I_t$. The actual reflection intensity level on the $k$th mirror can be computed as $\textbf{a}_k^T \textbf{p}$, where $\textbf{a}_k$ is given by the distances between all lamps to the mirror, and $\textbf{p}:=[p_1,...,p_n]^T$ are the power output of the lamps. The objective is to keep the actual intensity levels as close to the target as possible by tuning the power output $\textbf{p}$.

Formulate this problem as an optimization problem.
(5 points) Is your problem convex?
(5 points) If we require the overall power output of any of the $n$ lamps to be less than $p^*$, will the problem have a unique solution?
(5 points) If we require no more than half of the lamps to be switched on, will the problem have a unique solution?
